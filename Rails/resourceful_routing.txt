	********************************** Resourceful routing **********************************
	
--> It is a predefined routing in rails which cover the CRUD actions in controller

Syntax:   resources :[controller_name]

--> It is a combination of routes and controller actions to perform CRUD operations
--> It is applied in controller.rb


=> After applying resourceful routing we can check the routes that was created by this by rails route command


# Checking the routes

     Prefix     Verb   	     URI Pattern                                                 Controller#Action
       root     GET    	/                                                	 friends#index
      friends   GET    	/friends(.:format)                                               friends#index
                POST   	/friends(.:format)                                               friends#create
    new_friend  GET    	/friends/new(.:format)                                           friends#new
    edit_friend GET    	/friends/:id/edit(.:format)                                      friends#edit
    friend      GET    	/friends/:id(.:format)                                           friends#show
                PATCH  	/friends/:id(.:format)                                           friends#update
                PUT    	/friends/:id(.:format)                                           friends#update
                DELETE 	/friends/:id(.:format)                                           friends#destroy

All these routes are created by this resourceful routes i.e index, create, new, edit, show, update, destroy



# If we want to ignore some path to add, we use

resources :[controller_name], except: [:show]


# If we want to add only particular routes, then we use

resources :[controller_name], only: [:create, :edit]



# Adding custom routes in resources 

resources :[controller_name] do
	member do
	get :delete	    --> get :delete is not included in resourceful routes by default, we can add it through blocks
	end
            end	


# If we have to give the path of views which was created in resulrceful routing

--> We use the prefix of the routes and add _path or _url as a suffix to give a link to that view page


E.g :-	We want to move to edit page 
	<%= "Edit", edit_friend_path %>
	
	This will create a link to the edit page naming the button as "Edit"
	
	
	
# Usuage of routes path


friend_path	=>  {:controller => "friend", :action => "show"}
friend_path(2)  =>  {:controller => "friend", :action => "show", :id => 2}
		OR
friend/2	=>  {:controller => "friend", :action => "show", :id => 2}


Above hash is known as paramters and can be accessed by params[:key]
