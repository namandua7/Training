        ************************************************ Active record Basics ************************************************
        
   
1. Create a new project using
	$ rails new hms -d mysql		: hms (Hospital management system)
	
		: -d => used for giving database name
	--> This will create a new project containing required packages and git installed in it with database mysql
	
2. Now move to hms directory and open /config/database.yml

--> Set the username and password of your database host


3. Now the run the to create the database

	$ rails db:create
	
	--> This will create the database in development environment automatically
	
	
=> There are 3 types of environment of database creation in rails

a) Development --> When you sit down and start writing the code
b) Test --> When you sit down and test your code you just written from all possible angles, test to find bugs
c) Production --> When you take your code as much as bugs free and launch it on live server


4. Now to creating a model

	$ rails g model doctor
	
	invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20220830073225_create_doctors.rb
      create    app/models/doctor.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/doctor_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/doctors.yml

	--> This will create the following files and we have to work with first two files
	    (db/migrate/20220830073225_create_doctors.rb)
	    (app/models/doctor.rb)
	    
	    
	:Model is just like table
	
5. Now creating columns to that table in the file (db/migrate/20220830073225_create_doctors.rb)

	: Before adding columns content looks like
	
	class CreateDoctors < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
	  def change
	    create_table :doctors do |t|

	      t.timestamps
	    end
	  end
	end
	
	
	
	: After adding columns
	
	class CreateDoctors < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
	  def change
	    create_table :doctors do |t|
      
	      t.string :name
	      t.string :mobile
	      t.text :address
	      t.integer :experience

	      t.timestamps
	    end
	  end
	end

	--> We created columns name, mobile, address, experience
	
6. For adding this table to database, run

	$ rails db:migrate
	
	== 20220830073225 CreateDoctors: migrating ====================================
	-- create_table(:doctors)
	   -> 0.0078s
	== 20220830073225 CreateDoctors: migrated (0.0078s) ===========================


	--> This will create the table to database and add columns we define and also make a id column as a primary key, 	     created_at and updated_at
